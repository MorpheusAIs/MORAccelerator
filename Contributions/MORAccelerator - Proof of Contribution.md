# Proof of Contribution and Rewards 

## Bootstrap Alignment to Coder Bucket MRIs ðŸŒ±
The MORAccelerator, as described in [MRC50](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC50.md), will have preliminary alignment with the Coder bucket. Specifically, the MOR Accelerator will collaborate with and support the following existing MRIs:

- MRI Number 4	[TCM / MOR20 Token Standard for Fair Launches](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Capital%20Providers%2C%20MOR20%2C%20TCM/Techno%20Capital%20Machine%20(TCM).md)
- MRI Number 9	[Frontend Proofs & Examples](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/IN%20PROGRESS/MRC08.md)

## Why is the Builder Accelerator Starting in the Coder bucket? ðŸ™‹
Even though the Builder reward mechanism is not yet released, the Community of Builders is growing. May Builders are also Code contributors and intent on launching agents on Morpheus once Builder rewards are live. For this reason, it is sensible for the relevant Coder buckets to allocate weights towards accelerating builders in advance of the Metropolis phase, as depicted below.

## Eventual Alignment to Builder Rewards ðŸŒ¿
The Morpheus Builder Accelerator is intended to be transitioned from Coder rewards to Builder rewards once the intended Builder reward mechanism is completed. The following MRCs are being discussed within the community to solidify the Builder reward mechanism:

- [MRC 08](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/IN%20PROGRESS/MRC08.md): Waterloo Community Model
- [MRC 22](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/IN%20PROGRESS/MRC22.md): MOR Staking - A Free Market Mechanism To Direct MOR Rewards Toward Smart Agent & End User Applications Builders
- [MRC 41](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/IN%20PROGRESS/MRC41.md): MOR Staking For Builders
- [MRC 47](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC47.md): Distribution of Historical Builder Reward MOR Tokens Stored in the Smart Contract

The MORAccelerator Maintainer will work towards aligning a sustainability plan that enables the accelerator to be incentive aligned with Morpheus.

## Contribution Submissions âœ…
While the MOR Accelerator is aligned to Coder Bucket MRIs 4 and 9, contributors to MOR Accelerator can submit Proof of Contribution that aligns with [MRC50](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC50.md), which focuses on the initialization of the Morpheus Builder Accelerator.

Proof of Contribution submisions must be consistent with Code Provider contributions as described [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Contributions/Code%20-%20Proof_Of_Contribution.md). Weights included in the Proof of Contribution submissions must be discussed and agreed to the with the relevant maintainers.
